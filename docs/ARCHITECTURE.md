# Architecture (Current, 2025-09-07)

This section reflects the present codebase under src/commonMain and the CLI. It supersedes earlier design notes that referenced ZStream/ZInputStream.

## High-level modules
- io.github.kotlinmania.zlib.deflate.DeflateStream (object)
  - compressZlib(source: okio.BufferedSource, sink: okio.BufferedSink, level: Int = 6): Long
  - Emits zlib header, deflate blocks (stored/fixed/dynamic), and Adler-32 trailer.
- io.github.kotlinmania.zlib.inflate.InflateStream (functions)
  - inflateZlib(source: okio.BufferedSource, sink: okio.BufferedSink): Pair<Int, Long>
  - Parses zlib header, deflate blocks, validates data, returns (Z_OK, bytesOut) on success.
- io.github.kotlinmania.zlib.inflate.StreamingBitReader / StreamingBitWriter
  - LSB-first bit I/O over Okio streams with small in-memory buffers; writer uses ArithmeticBitwiseOps for arithmetic-only shifts.
- io.github.kotlinmania.zlib.inflate.CanonicalHuffman
  - Builds canonical encoders/decoders and full decode tables; used by both compression and decompression.
- io.github.kotlinmania.zlib.bitwise.*
  - BitShiftEngine (NATIVE/ARITHMETIC) with ShiftResult metadata.
  - BitwiseOps (pure helpers and urShiftImproved for Int/Long).
  - ArithmeticBitwiseOps (Long-based arithmetic-only bitwise primitives).
  - BitBuffer (simple buffered bit manipulations for algorithms).
- io.github.kotlinmania.zlib.bitwise.checksum.Adler32Utils
  - Arithmetic-only Adler-32 implementation: adler32(adler: Long, buf: ByteArray?, index: Int, len: Int).
- io.github.kotlinmania.zlib.common.Constants
  - Centralized zlib constants (levels, strategies, return codes, Huffman and window parameters), and version().
- io.github.kotlinmania.zlib.cli.ZLibCli
  - CLI entry point: compress|deflate, decompress|inflate, log-on/off using Okio FileSystem.

## Data flow (current)
- Compression: BufferedSource -> DeflateStream.compressZlib -> StreamingBitWriter -> sink (BufferedSink) + Adler32 trailer.
- Decompression: source (BufferedSource) -> StreamingBitReader + InflateStream.inflateZlib -> sink (BufferedSink).
- Huffman: CanonicalHuffman builds/consumes tables for fixed/dynamic modes.
- Bitwise: Writers and helpers avoid undefined platform shifts by using arithmetic implementations when required.

## Notes
- IO is based on Okio for portability across KMP.
- Bitwise operations for algorithmic correctness are centralized; Adler32Utils does not use BitShiftEngine.
- Return codes and constants come from io.github.kotlinmania.zlib.common.Constants.

# Legacy Architecture (historical)

# Architecture Document: ZLib Implementation

This document outlines the refactored architecture of the Kotlin ZLib implementation.

## Overview

The primary goal of the refactoring was to improve code organization, reduce file sizes, and separate concerns by:
- Centralizing constants.
- Extracting utility/helper functions.
- Moving inner classes to their own files.

## Key Components

### 1. Constants
- **`src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/zlib/common/Constants.kt`**: Houses all global constants for the zlib operations (e.g., status codes, compression levels, algorithm-specific fixed values).

### 2. Core Logic Files (Illustrative - actual cleanup was partial)
- **`src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/zlib/deflate/Deflate.kt`**: Contains the main logic for ZLib deflation (compression).
  - *Intended Refactoring*: Many helper functions were moved to `DeflateUtils.kt`. Original methods in `Deflate.kt` were intended to be cleaned up to delegate to these utilities, but this was deferred due to tooling issues.
- **`src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/zlib/deflate/Inflate.kt`**: Contains the main logic for ZLib inflation (decompression).
- **`src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/zlib/deflate/InfBlocks.kt`**: Manages inflation blocks.
  - *Intended Refactoring*: The `inflate_flush` utility was moved to `InfBlocksUtils.kt`. Original method in `InfBlocks.kt` was intended to be cleaned up, but this was deferred.
- **`src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/zlib/deflate/Tree.kt`**: Logic for Huffman tree construction.
  - *Refactoring*: Utility functions moved to `TreeUtils.kt`. `Tree.kt` now contains wrappers or calls these directly.

### 3. Utility Modules
- **`src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/zlib/deflate/DeflateUtils.kt`**: Contains helper functions extracted from `Deflate.kt`. These functions perform specific sub-tasks of the deflation process (e.g., byte/bit manipulation, block handling).
- **`src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/zlib/deflate/InfBlocksUtils.kt`**: Contains helper functions extracted from `InfBlocks.kt` (currently `inflate_flush`).
- **`src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/zlib/deflate/TreeUtils.kt`**: Contains helper functions for Huffman tree operations, extracted from `Tree.kt`.

### 4. Configuration
- **`src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/zlib/deflate/Config.kt`**: Defines the `Config` class used to store deflation parameters for different compression levels.

### 5. Other Key Classes
- **`src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/zlib/deflate/ZStream.kt`**: Manages the overall stream state for both compression and decompression.
- **`src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/zlib/deflate/Adler32.kt`**: Implements the Adler-32 checksum algorithm.
- **`src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/zlib/deflate/StaticTree.kt`**: Defines the static Huffman trees used in compression.
- **`src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/zlib/deflate/InfCodes.kt`**: Handles Huffman codes during inflation.
- **`src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/zlib/deflate/ZInputStream.kt`**: Provides an `InputStream` interface for ZLib operations.
- **`src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/zlib/deflate/ZStreamException.kt`**: Custom exception class.

## Detailed Process Flows

### Deflate Process

The deflation process, primarily managed by `Deflate.kt`, involves several stages. Key utility functions from `DeflateUtils.kt` are intended to support these stages.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Deflate Operations"
        direction LR
        DeflateCore["Deflate.kt(Core deflation logic, e.g., deflate_fast, deflate_slow, longest_match)"]
        DeflateUtils["DeflateUtils.kt(Bit/Byte I/O, block handling, data type setting)"]
        Config["Config.kt(Compression parameters)"]
        Tree["Tree.kt(Huffman tree construction - uses TreeUtils)"]
        StaticTree["StaticTree.kt(Static tree definitions)"]
        Constants_Def["common/Constants.kt"]
    end

    subgraph "ZStream Handling"
        ZStream_Def["ZStream.kt(Stream state)"]
    end

    DeflateCore -->|Uses for params| Config
    DeflateCore -->|Uses for bit/byte I/O, block ops| DeflateUtils
    DeflateCore -->|Uses for Huffman trees| Tree
    DeflateCore -->|References| StaticTree
    DeflateCore -->|Accesses| ZStream_Def
    DeflateCore -->|Uses constants| Constants_Def
    DeflateUtils -->|Uses constants| Constants_Def
    Tree -->|Uses constants| Constants_Def
    Config -->|Uses constants| Constants_Def
```
*Note: Ideally, `Deflate.kt` would have all its helper methods (now in `DeflateUtils.kt`) removed and would delegate all such calls. This cleanup was deferred due to tooling issues.*

### Inflate Process

The inflation process, managed by `Inflate.kt` and supported by `InfBlocks.kt` and `InfCodes.kt`, also relies on centralized constants and is intended to use extracted utilities.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Inflate Operations"
        direction LR
        InflateCore["Inflate.kt(Core inflation state machine)"]
        InfBlocks["InfBlocks.kt(Manages inflation blocks, windowing - uses InfBlocksUtils)"]
        InfCodes["InfCodes.kt(Huffman code processing)"]
        InfBlocksUtils["InfBlocksUtils.kt(e.g., inflate_flush)"]
        Constants_Inf2["common/Constants.kt"]
    end
    subgraph "ZStream Handling"
        direction LR
        ZStream_Inf["ZStream.kt(Stream state, Adler32 checksum)"]
        Adler32["Adler32.kt"]
    end

    InflateCore --> InfBlocks
    InflateCore --> ZStream_Inf
    InflateCore --> InfCodes %% Indirectly via InfBlocks
    InflateCore --> Constants_Inf2

    InfBlocks --> InfBlocksUtils
    InfBlocks --> InfCodes
    InfBlocks --> ZStream_Inf %% For Adler32 reference via z.istate.blocks.reset(z, z.istate.was)
    InfBlocks --> Constants_Inf2


    InfCodes --> Constants_Inf2
    ZStream_Inf --> Adler32
    ZStream_Inf --> Constants_Inf2
    Adler32 --> Constants_Inf2
```
*Note: Ideally, `InfBlocks.kt` would have its `inflate_flush` method removed and would delegate the call. This cleanup was deferred due to tooling issues.*

## Conclusion

This refactoring effort aimed to improve the modularity and readability of the ZLib Kotlin port. Key achievements include:
- Centralization of all constants into `common/Constants.kt`.
- Extraction of the `Config` class into its own file.
- Creation of utility modules (`TreeUtils.kt`, `DeflateUtils.kt`, `InfBlocksUtils.kt`) populated with helper functions from their respective core logic files.

While the direct cleanup of `Deflate.kt` and `InfBlocks.kt` (removing original methods and updating all call sites) faced persistent tooling challenges and was deferred, the new utility structure provides a clearer separation of concerns for future development and maintenance. The codebase is now better organized, laying the groundwork for further improvements.
